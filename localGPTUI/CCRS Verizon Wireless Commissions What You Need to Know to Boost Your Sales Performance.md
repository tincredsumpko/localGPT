## What is CCRS?
 
CCRS stands for Customer Care and Retention Services. It is a program that Verizon Wireless launched in 2019 to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. CCRS aims to provide customers with personalized and proactive solutions that address their needs and concerns. CCRS also helps customers save money by offering them discounts, credits, or promotions on their wireless services or devices.
 
CCRS is not a separate department or team within Verizon Wireless. Rather, it is a set of tools and processes that agents and retailers can use to enhance their customer interactions. CCRS enables agents and retailers to access customer information, such as account history, usage patterns, device preferences, and satisfaction scores. CCRS also provides agents and retailers with recommendations on how to best serve each customer, such as offering a device upgrade, a plan change, or a loyalty reward.
  
## How does CCRS work?
 
CCRS works by identifying customers who are at risk of leaving Verizon Wireless or who have expressed dissatisfaction with their service or device. These customers are called "CCRS opportunities". CCRS opportunities are generated by various sources, such as customer surveys, call center interactions, online feedback, social media comments, or network performance data.
 
When a CCRS opportunity is identified, it is assigned to an agent or retailer who has the most relevant relationship with the customer. For example, if the customer bought their device from a specific retailer, that retailer will be assigned the CCRS opportunity. If the customer has no specific retailer affiliation, the CCRS opportunity will be assigned to an agent who has previously interacted with the customer or who has the most suitable skills and availability.
 
The assigned agent or retailer will then contact the customer via phone, email, text message, or in-store visit. The agent or retailer will use the CCRS tools and processes to understand the customer's needs and concerns, offer personalized solutions, and resolve any issues. The agent or retailer will also try to upsell or cross-sell additional products or services that may benefit the customer.
 
If the customer accepts the offer or solution, the agent or retailer will complete the transaction and confirm the customer's satisfaction. The agent or retailer will then report the outcome of the interaction to Verizon Wireless through the CCRS portal. The outcome may be one of the following:
 
- Retention: The customer agrees to stay with Verizon Wireless for another contract term or period.
- Recovery: The customer cancels their service but agrees to come back within a specified time frame.
- Save: The customer reduces their monthly bill by changing their plan or device.
- Upgrade: The customer increases their monthly bill by adding a new line, device, feature, or service.
- No action: The customer declines any offer or solution and remains with their current plan or device.
