# Solution Manual for Graph Theory with Applications by Bondy and Murty
 
Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the properties and applications of graphs, which are structures consisting of vertices (or nodes) and edges (or links) connecting them. Graph theory has many applications in various fields, such as computer science, engineering, biology, chemistry, social sciences, and more.

One of the most popular textbooks on graph theory is *Graph Theory with Applications* by J. A. Bondy and U. S. R. Murty, first published in 1976 and revised in 2008. This book covers the basic concepts and results of graph theory, as well as some advanced topics and applications. It also contains many exercises for students to practice and test their understanding.
 
However, finding a solution manual for this book is not easy. According to a [question](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4082917/solution-manual-for-graph-theory-with-applicationsbondy-and-murty) posted on Mathematics Stack Exchange, there is no official solution manual for this book. Some users suggested looking for online resources that provide solutions or hints for some of the exercises, such as [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/vvvvalvalval/Graph-Theory-Bondy-Murty-2008-study-notes/blob/master/Exercises-solutions-hints.adoc) or [this website](https://puremathematics.mt/bondy-murty-graph-theory-exercise-1-1-1/). However, these resources are incomplete and may not be reliable.
 
Therefore, if you are looking for a solution manual for *Graph Theory with Applications* by Bondy and Murty, you may have to rely on your own efforts or seek help from your instructors or peers. Alternatively, you may consider using another textbook on graph theory that has a solution manual available, such as *Introduction to Graph Theory* by Douglas B. West or *A First Course in Graph Theory* by Gary Chartrand and Ping Zhang.

However, learning graph theory also requires some effort and practice. You need to understand the definitions, theorems, proofs, and examples of graph theory, as well as how to apply them to various situations. You also need to develop your skills in constructing and analyzing graphs, finding patterns and properties, and devising algorithms and solutions.
 
One of the best ways to learn graph theory is to work on exercises that challenge your understanding and test your knowledge. Exercises can help you reinforce what you have learned, discover new ideas, and improve your problem-solving skills. They can also make you more confident and motivated in studying graph theory.
 
That is why having a solution manual for your textbook can be very helpful. A solution manual can provide you with detailed explanations and answers for the exercises in your textbook. It can also give you feedback and guidance on how to approach and solve different types of problems. A solution manual can be a valuable resource for self-study or revision.
